## Overview

This app solves a simple but critical problem: **missed calls = lost opportunities**.

When you miss a call, the app instantly sends a predefined SMS message to that caller, letting them know you'll get back to them. This keeps leads warm and shows professionalism even when you're busy.

### Current Implementation Highlights

✅ **Jetpack Compose** with Material 3 design
✅ **Latest stable tooling** (AGP 8.7.0, Gradle 8.9, Kotlin 2.0)
✅ **DataStore Preferences** for modern, reactive data persistence
✅ **Foreground service** for reliable background operation
✅ **Smart debounce** to prevent spamming the same number
✅ **Free tier enforcement** with upgrade path
✅ **Clean architecture** with separation of concerns
✅ **Secure config plumbing** via Gradle properties and `BuildConfig`

## Prerequisites

### Development Environment

- **Android Studio**: Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or newer
- **JDK**: Java 17 or higher
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

### For Testing

- **Physical Android Device** (recommended) or Emulator
- **Android 8.0+** (API 26 or higher)
- **Active SIM card** (for SMS sending on real device)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blunts954-png/mctb.git
cd mctb
```

### 2. Open in Android Studio
### 2.5 Configure local secrets (required for release/cloud/billing verification)

Create or update your local `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```properties
MCTB_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=...
MCTB_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
NEON_DATA_API_URL=...
NEON_API_KEY=...
MASTER_GOD_MODE_PASSWORD=...
BILLING_VERIFY_URL=https://your-backend.example.com/api/billing/verify
```

For local dev, blank values are allowed, but production features will be disabled when required keys are missing.


1. Launch Android Studio
2. Select **File → Open**
3. Navigate to the cloned `mctb` directory
4. Click **OK**
5. Wait for Gradle sync to complete (first sync may take a few minutes)

### 3. Run on Device/Emulator

1. Connect an Android device via USB (with USB debugging enabled)
   - OR start an Android emulator
2. Select your device from the device dropdown
3. Click the **Run** button (▶️) or press `Shift + F10`
4. App will install and launch automatically

## Building the APK

### Debug APK (for testing)

```bash
# From project root directory
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Output: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

### Release APK (for distribution)

#### Option 1: Unsigned Release Build

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Output: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk`

### Install APK on Device

```bash
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## How It Works

### High-Level Flow

```
1. User enables auto-reply in app
   ↓
2. Foreground service starts, displays persistent notification
   ↓
3. Phone call comes in → RINGING state
   ↓
4. User doesn't answer → IDLE state (without OFFHOOK)
   ↓
5. CallReceiver detects missed call
   ↓
6. SmsHandler validates conditions:
   - App enabled? ✓
   - Within active hours? ✓
   - Under free tier limit? ✓
   - Not recently texted this number? ✓
   - Valid phone number? ✓
   ↓
7. SMS sent via Android SmsManager
   ↓
8. Usage counter incremented
   ↓
9. Timestamp recorded for debounce
```

### Missed Call Detection

The app uses a state machine approach to detect missed calls:

| Previous State | Current State | Interpretation |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| IDLE | RINGING | Incoming call started |
| RINGING | OFFHOOK | Call was answered |
| RINGING | IDLE | **Missed call** (never answered) |
| OFFHOOK | IDLE | Call ended normally |

---

## Permissions Explained

The app requires the following permissions:

| Permission | Purpose | When Requested |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| `READ_PHONE_STATE` | Detect incoming calls | On first enable |
| `READ_CALL_LOG` | Identify missed vs answered calls | On first enable |
| `SEND_SMS` | Send auto-reply messages | On first enable |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Show foreground service notification (API 33+) | On first enable |
| `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | Restart service after reboot | Granted at install |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` | Run background monitoring service | Granted at install |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_PHONE_CALL` | Specify service type for call monitoring | Granted at install |
| `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` | Suggest disabling battery optimization | User-initiated |

## Architecture

### Key Components

#### AppPreferences

- Wraps DataStore Preferences
- Exposes reactive Flows for UI observation
- Provides suspend functions for writes
- Includes sync read helpers for background operations
- Handles debounce tracking and usage counting

#### SmsHandler

- Validates all conditions before sending SMS
- Checks: enabled state, active hours, limit, debounce, number validity
- Wraps Android SmsManager
- Filters out invalid/unknown numbers

#### CallReceiver

- Listens for PHONE_STATE broadcasts
- Tracks call state transitions
- Detects missed call pattern (RINGING → IDLE without OFFHOOK)
- Delegates to SmsHandler in coroutine scope

#### CallMonitorService

- Foreground service for process stability
- Creates notification channel (API 26+)
- Displays minimal low-priority notification
- Returns START_STICKY for auto-restart

## Assumptions & Design Decisions

### Senior-Level Assumptions Made

1. **No Billing Integration**: Upgrade button is a placeholder. Production would integrate Google Play Billing Library.

2. **Simple Upgrade Flow**: One-time upgrade to unlimited. Could be expanded to subscriptions or tiered pricing.

3. **No Analytics**: No tracking, no crash reporting. Production app would likely add Firebase Analytics + Crashlytics.

4. **No Server Component**: All data stored locally. Future versions might sync settings/usage across devices.

5. **SMS Only**: Doesn't support other messaging apps (WhatsApp, etc). Android SMS only.

6. **Single SIM Assumed**: On dual-SIM devices, uses default SMS SIM. Could be enhanced to select SIM.

7. **Fixed Debounce Window**: 30 minutes hardcoded. Could be made user-configurable.

8. **English Only**: All strings in English. Production would use string resources for i18n.

### Why DataStore Over SharedPreferences

- **Type-safe**: Preferences API provides type safety
- **Asynchronous**: Non-blocking operations by default
- **Reactive**: Flow-based observation for UI updates
- **Coroutine-friendly**: Integrates seamlessly with Kotlin coroutines
- **Future-proof**: SharedPreferences is legacy, DataStore is the modern approach

### Why Jetpack Compose Over XML

- **Less boilerplate**: Declarative UI reduces code by ~40%
- **Type safety**: Compose is compile-time checked
- **Reactivity**: State changes automatically update UI
- **Modern**: XML layouts are legacy, Compose is the future
- **Dynamic theming**: Material 3 dynamic colors work better in Compose

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**Problem**: Gradle sync fails with "SDK location not found"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Create local.properties file
echo "sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/Sdk" > local.properties
```

### Runtime Issues

**Problem**: App doesn't detect missed calls

**Solution**:
1. Verify all permissions granted
2. Check battery optimization is disabled
3. Ensure service is running (notification should be visible)
4. Try rebooting device

**Problem**: Service stops working after some time

**Solution**:
1. Disable battery optimization (critical on Xiaomi, Huawei, OnePlus devices)
2. Add app to manufacturer's "protected apps" list
3. Disable "Adaptive Battery" for this app
